## üìù Projects

### Data Pipeline for Jira platform

</a>

**Overview** <br/>
In this project, I built a data pipleine to extract data for the purpose of team reporting, task monitoring as well as progress tracking. Firstly data was extracted from Jira and loaded to Bigquery. Airbyte was used as an integration tool for extraction and loading. Finally, I utilized data build tool (aka dbt) to transform data into reportable form which was then consumed by Looker Studio. Good source of data along with appropriate transformation plan create a solid dashboard where users can analyze from multiple angles with different dimensions.

Kimball's Dimensional Modeling principles is applied when designing data model especially such hard techniques as snapshot fact table, hierarchy bridge table, etc. Besides, I also implemented data quality check with dbt Test and other add-ins.
